# T-004

- objective: support project date fields in pull direction
- scope:
  - read configured date fields from Project item values
  - map remote start/due/completed into local task fields
  - preserve existing conflict and source-of-truth rules
- acceptance:
  - pull updates local `start` and `due` from Project
  - completed date remains consistent with done transitions

- implementation-note:
  - added Project date reads in pull flow with optional field IDs
