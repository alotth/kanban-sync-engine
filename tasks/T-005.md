# T-005

- objective: extend sync for additional project fields
- candidates:
  - `priority` as single-select Project field
  - `workload` as single-select or numeric Project field
- constraints:
  - keep mapping optional and config-driven
  - avoid breaking users that only configure status/date
- acceptance:
  - clear mapping rules documented and implemented
